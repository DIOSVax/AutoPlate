### Run your own version of the web application

1. Get the source code from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhilPalmer/AutoPlate.git
cd AutoPlate
```

2. See [`app.R`](app.R) for how you can run you own version of the app yourself locally

Once you've loaded the library you can run AutoPlate like so:
```bash
RScript app.R
```
