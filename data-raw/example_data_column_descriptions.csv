"column_name","input_format","column_type","column_description"
"WellPosition","pMN","character","Position of well on the 96-plate. Consists of the row letter (`A`-`H`) and column number (`1`-`12`), seperated by a colon (`:`), eg `A:1`"
"RLU","pMN","integer","Relative luminescence units raw value generated by the plate reader"
"wrow","AutoPlate","character","Well row on the 96-well plate eg `A`"
"wcol","AutoPlate","integer","Well column on the 96-well plate eg `1`"
"types","AutoPlate","character","The well types, available options are: `c` = cell only control, `m` = monoclonal antibody (posotive control), `v` = virus (or pseudotype) only control, `x` = serum sample"
"sample_id","AutoPlate","character","Unique identifier for each sample/subject eg `Sample 1`"
"dilution","AutoPlate","integer","Concentration/dilution of serum or control sample (1:XX)"
"virus","AutoPlate","character","Virus (or pseudovirus) that was used in the assay eg `SARS-CoV-2`"
"treatment","AutoPlate","character","Used to group the data for the dose-response curves, for example, what the subjects were inoculated with eg `mAb1` or `Vaccine 1`"
"bleed","AutoPlate","character","Integer corresponding to the week the sample (eg mouse) was bled or `terminal` for the last bleed. Can be left blank for clinical samples"
"experiment_id","AutoPlate","character","Unique identifier specifying which study generated the data eg `COV001`"
"rlu","AutoPlate","integer","Relative luminescence units raw value generated by the plate reader"
"neutralisation","AutoPlate","numeric","The ability of the antibody to bind to the virus and block cell entry. Calculated from the `rlu` and normalised/expresed as a percentage using the median cell-only (100% neutralisation) and virus-only (0% neutralisation) wells for the plate"
"exclude","AutoPlate","logical","`TRUE` or `FALSE` value to exclude wells from the analysis. Wells could be excluded for any number of reasons but are most commonly excluded when the controls have failed or when wells were left empty on a particular plate."
"plate_number","AutoPlate","character","Unique 96-well plate name or number eg `1`"
"filename","AutoPlate","character","File basename that is used to generate the plate number"
